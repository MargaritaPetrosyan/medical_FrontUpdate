              <h2>General information</h2>
              <p>
                An arm lift is a popular cosmetic procedure that removes excess
                skin from the under part of your arm from the armpit to the
                elbow. While exercise can strengthen your upper arm muscles, it
                cannot tighten the skin overlying the muscles. Patients choose
                this procedure because droopy under-arm skin is hard to hide,
                especially if you want to wear short sleeves.
              </p>
              <h2>Before Surgery</h2>
              <> An initial visit with your plastic surgeon may take place via
              telehealth or in person. Your surgeon will review your medical
              history including previous surgeries, medications you are taking,
              and conditions that may put you at risk for surgery. During an
              in-person visit, your plastic surgeon will examine you, assess
              your goals, and determine whether an arm lift procedure will give
              you the results you seek. Your surgeon may recommend that you quit
              smoking for a period of time or discontinue medication before
              surgery to ensure the best possible outcome.

              <h2>Understanding the Risks</h2>
              <p>
                An arm lift carries the same risks as any other standard minor
                surgery. These include the risk of bleeding and blood clots,
                infection, and risks associated with anesthesia. Your doctor
                will discuss these possibilities with you.
              </p>

              <h2>Pre-surgical Testing</h2>
              <p>
                Once your surgery has been scheduled, you will meet with an
                anesthesia specialist to ensure you are in good health.
                Depending on your health, you may be scheduled for pre-surgical
                testing that can include blood work, an EKG, or other tests to
                ensure you are ready for surgery.
              </p>
              <h2>On the Day of Your Brachioplasty</h2>
              <p>
                A brachioplasty procedure typically takes about one to two
                hours. During this time, your surgeon will make an incision in
                your upper arm, remove excess skin, then tighten and smooth the
                remaining skin. You will be discharged the same day. Your
                Recovery
              </p>
              <h2>Recovery</h2>
              <p>
                You will wear compression garments for about four to six weeks
                to minimize swelling. You should be able to resume your normal
                activities within one week, but your doctor will recommend that
                you avoid major physical activity, particularly heavy lifting,
                for up to six weeks. Your doctor will see you for a
                post-operative clinic visit to examine your scar and to ensure
                you are healing in a timely fashion.
